\section{Definition of done}

This section will describe when we will consider a backlog item, sprint or release as done.
\subsection{Backlog items}
Backlog items will be done when the item is finished according to the responsible team member and at least one other member reviewed the work done and merged the code with the branch of the current sprint. In case of documents, at least one other member should have read the document.
\subsection{Sprints}
We’ll consider a sprint as done when all items in the backlog are finished. When an item for some reason isn’t finished it should be discussed with all group members, if necessary the item can move on to the next sprint. At the end of the sprint there should be at least a running version, with properly documented code that passes all tests.
\subsection{Releases}
 A release is considered done when we handed in all deliverables and have done the demo for that release. At least the must-haves should be implemented and all tests should pass.
