"Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort." is what Paul J. Meyer, one of the world's most outstanding authorities in the fields of goal setting, motivation, time management, and personal and professional development, said about productivity in groups and it is exactly what we aim to accomplish during this project. by carefully planning the steps that we will take during the upcoming weeks we try to be as productive as possible. In this document we will go over many of the planning properties that we will use to describe the steps that we will take during the time of the project.
