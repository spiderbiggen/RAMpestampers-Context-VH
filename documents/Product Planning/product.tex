\subsection{High-level product backlog}
In this section, the features are described in more detail.

\subsubsection{Must have's}
The following features are critical to the deliverable, if these features are not included, the project deliverable should be considered as failure.\\
\indent	-        The agent must make decisions based on his goals.\\
\indent	-        The agent is able to build stuff.\\
\indent	-        The agent is able to destroy stuff.\\

\subsection{Roadmap}
The planning for the project is shown in this table.\\

\textbf{Design phase}\\

In this phase we will mostly be playing the Tygron game and discussing with other groups in order to construct a game which is interesting enough for the agents to function in.\\

\textbf{Sprint 1}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Practice with the Tygron engine
  \item Think about possible roles for agents
  \item Discuss roles with the other groups
  \item Visit Tygron\\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sprint 2}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Make project vision and planning
  \item Select an area for the game
  \item Edit the area to make it fit for the project
  \item Distribute the roles among the groups\\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sprint 3}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare the demo for the game together with the other groups
  \item Start implementing basic functionalities for role
  \item Test the added functionalities
  \item Write tests for the connector changes
  \item If needed, make changes and additions to the connector\\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sprint 4}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Add or change functionalities for the agent
