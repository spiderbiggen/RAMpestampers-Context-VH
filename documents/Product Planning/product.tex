\section{Product}

In this section we willl describe the agent for the role of TU Delft in the Tygron game. First we will give an overview of the high level product backlog. After that we will describe our planning for this product with a roadmap.

\subsection{High-level product backlog}
In this section we will describe the different features of our agent for the role of TU Delft in the Tygron game. To describe these features we are going to use MoSCoW.

\subsubsection{Must have's}
The following features are critical to the deliverable, if these features are not included, the project deliverable should be considered as failure.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The agent must make decisions based on his goals.
	\item The agent must be able to build buildings.
	\item The agent must be able to destroy buildings.
	\item The agent must be able to buy and sell land.
	\item  The agent must be able to negotiate with other agents.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should have's}
The following features can be as much important as the must haves but are not necessary for the deliverable.
\begin{itemize}
	\item  The agent should be able to transfer money to another stakeholder.
	\item The user should be able to easily start a simulation.
	\item The user should be able to understand why an agent makes certain decisions if the user knows the goals of the agent.
	\item The user should be able to understand what the goals of the role TU Delft are.
	\item The agent should not get stuck when a request is denied and will make a new request or start another plan to achieve his goals.
	\item The agent should drop all his goals when he is stuck and try to work on something else. 
	\item The agent should not go bankrupt.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could have's}
The following features are desirable but not necessary, and could improve user experience or customer satisfaction.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The agent could build parking space for each faculty according to the required amount.
	\item The agent could acquire green and water at the campus area according to the required amount.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Roadmap}
The planning for the project is shown in this table.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Design phase}\\
In this phase we will mostly be playing the Tygron game and discussing with other groups in order to construct a game which is interesting enough for the agents to function in.


\item\textbf{Sprint 1}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Practice with the Tygron engine
  \item Think about possible roles for agents
  \item Discuss roles with the other groups
  \item Visit Tygron
\end{itemize}


\item\textbf{Sprint 2}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Make project vision and planning
  \item Select an area for the game
  \item Edit the area to make it fit for the project
  \item Distribute the roles among the groups
  \item Start implementing basic functionalities for role
  \item Prepare the demo for the game together with the other groups
\end{itemize}


\item\textbf{Sprint 3}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Start implementing functionalities for role
  \item Test the added functionalities
  \item Write tests for the connector changes
  \item If needed, make changes and additions to the connector
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\item\textbf{Sprint 4}

\begin{itemize}
