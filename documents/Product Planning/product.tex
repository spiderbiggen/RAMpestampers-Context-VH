\subsection{High-level product backlog}
In this section, the features are described in more detail.

\subsubsection{Must have's}
The following features are critical to the deliverable, if these features are not included, the project deliverable should be considered as failure.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The agent must make decisions based on his goals.
	\item The agent is able to build stuff.
	\item The agent is able to destroy stuff.
	\item The agent is able to buy land.

\begin{itemize}
	\item  An agent should be able to transfer money to another stakeholder.
	\item The user should be able to easily start a simulation.
	\item The user should be able to understand why an agent makes certain decisions if the user know the goals of the agent.

\subsection{Roadmap}
The planning for the project is shown in this table.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Design phase}\\
In this phase we will mostly be playing the Tygron game and discussing with other groups in order to construct a game which is interesting enough for the agents to function in.


\item\textbf{Sprint 1}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Practice with the Tygron engine
  \item Think about possible roles for agents

  \item Distribute the roles among the groups
\end{itemize}


\item\textbf{Sprint 3}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare the demo for the game together with the other groups
  \item Start implementing basic functionalities for role
  \item Test the added functionalities
