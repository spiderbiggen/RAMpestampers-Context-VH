\section{Product}

In this section we willl describe the agent for the role of TU Delft in the Tygron game. First we will give an overview of the high level product backlog. After that we will describe our planning for this product with a roadmap.

\subsection{High-level product backlog}
In this section we will describe the different features of our agent for the role of TU Delft in the Tygron game. To describe these features we are going to use MoSCoW.

\subsubsection{Must have's}
The following features are critical to the deliverable, if these features are not included, the project deliverable should be considered as failure.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The agent must make decisions based on his goals.
	\item The agent must be able to build buildings.
	\item The agent must be able to destroy buildings.
	\item The agent must be able to buy and sell land.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should have's}
The following features can be as much important as the must haves but are not necessary for the deliverable.
\begin{itemize}
	\item  The agent must be able to negotiate with other agents.
	\item  The agent should be able to transfer money to another stakeholder.
	\item The agent should never get stuck and always try to achieve his goals.
	\item The agent should not go bankrupt.
	\item The agent should act as any other human player.
	\item The agent should make for other players understandable decisions based on his goals.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could have's}
The following features are desirable but not necessary, and could improve user experience or customer satisfaction.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The agent could build parking space for each faculty according to the required amount.
	\item The agent could acquire green and water at the campus area according to the required amount.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Wont have's}
The following features are undesirable, and will not be implemented for the
agent.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The agent won’t have the ability to grant permits to other stakeholders.
	\item The agent won’t be able to build any kind of housing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Roadmap}
The planning for the project is shown in this table.

\begin{itemize}
