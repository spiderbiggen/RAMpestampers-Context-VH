\section{Product Backlog}
The following section describes our product backlog in the form of user stories. These user stories give us a way to see some of the requirements for our agent and help us in estimating the amount of work that will be required to create a good agent, by giving us a visual indication of all the things that need to be done.
\subsection{User stories of features}

In this section we will describe the user stories of the features of the project. This section aims to clarify what the different actors want to be able to do during a session of the game. The prioritization goes from high priority to low, based on the essential functions that the system should have.\\
\\
As a user\\
When I start the environment\\
I want to be able to easily start a simulation.\\
\\
As a user\\
When running a simulation\\
I can see an agent trying to achieve its goals and eventually come as close to its goals as possible in the environment.\\
To be able to monitor the agent.\\
\\
As a user\\
When running a simulation\\
I can understand why an agent would make a certain decision if I know the goals of this agent.\\
\\
As a user\\
When running a simulation\\
It becomes clear to me what the TU Delft wants to happen to the TU-wijk and how the TU Delft makes this happen.\\
To understand the choices that the agent in a current situation will make.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to make decisions based on my goals and based on the possible outcomes of this decision.\\
To be able to reach the goals that were set.\\
\\
\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to buy ground if I think this is benificial for me.\\
To construct things that are part of my goals.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to destroy stuff if I think this is benificial for me.\\
To make room for construction or to optimize a certain indicator.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to give other agents money if I think this is benificial for me.\\
To optimize a certain indicator or to make a good deal.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to build stuff if I think this is benificial for me.\\
To optimize a certain indicator or to reach a construction goal.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to send requests to other agents to negotiate about things I need.\\
To try to receive things that I need for reaching a certain goal.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
My goals are to build new faculties, renovate old faculties, keep a healthy financial state and have enough parking space and trees on the campus.\\
To optimize all my indicators.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I will not get stuck when a request is denied and I will make a new request or start another plan to achieve my goals.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When I get stuck in a simulation\\
I will drop all my goals at that moment and try to work on something else.\\
To be able to continue trying to reach my goals.

\subsection{User stories of defects}
There are no user stories yet, because for now we do not have any defects.

\subsection{User stories of technical improvements}
As a developer\\
When the connector doesn't support my needs\\
I will improve the connector in a way that it will support my needs.\\
\\
As a developer\\
When the tygron engine doesn't support my needs\\
I will ask tygron to add something to the engine.

\subsection{User stories of know-how acquisition}
As a developer\\
When I need to know something about the tygron sdk\\
I look it up on the wiki or ask someone from tygron.\\
\\
As a developer\\
When I need to know something about goal\\
I look into the documentation or look on the github page.


\subsection{Initial release plan}

This section contains the schedule of all our releases over the coming weeks. We divided this period in 3 stages. Every stage roughly represents 2 weeks, starting in week 4. The last stage represents only one week, in this week we will optimize our agent and finish it. Because we are not sure yet how much work every part is and what will be difficult our schedule is somewhat loose at the moment. This will change when we start writing code, because we will get a better view of the items that take a lot of time at that point.\\
