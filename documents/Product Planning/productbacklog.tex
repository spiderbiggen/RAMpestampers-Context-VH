\subsection{User stories of features}
As a user\\
When I start the environment\\
I want to be able to easily start a simulation.\\
\\
As a user\\
When running a simulation\\
I see an agent trying to achieve its goals and eventually come as close to its goals as possible in the environment.\\
\\
As a user\\
When running a simulation\\
I can understand why an agent would make a certain decision if I know the goals of this agent.\\
\\
As a user\\
When running a simulation\\
It becomes clear to me what the TU Delft wants to happen to the TU-wijk and how the TU Delft makes this happen.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to make decisions based on my goals and based on the possible outcomes of this decision.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to buy ground if I think this is benificial for me.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to destroy stuff if I think this is benificial for me.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to give other agents money if I think this is benificial for me.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to build stuff if I think this is benificial for me.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to send requests to other agents to negotiate about things I need.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
My goals are to build new faculties, renovate old faculties, keep a healthy financial state and have enough parking space and trees on the campus.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I will not get stuck when a request is denied and I will make a new request or start another plan to achieve my goals.\\
\\
As an agent\\
When I get stuck in a simulation\\
I will drop all my goals at that moment and try to work on something else

\subsection{User stories of defects}
As a developer\\
When I find a defect in goal or in the connector\\
I will try to fix it myself or ask someone to fix this.\\
\\
As a developer\\
When a defect can't be fixed\\
I will work around it in goal to get the functionality needed.

\subsection{User stories of technical improvements}
As a developer\\
When the connector doesn't support my needs\\
I will improve the connector in a way that it will support my needs.\\
\\
As a developer\\
When the tygron engine doesn't support my needs\\
I will ask tygron to add something to the engine.\\

\subsection{Initial release plan}

This section contains the schedule of all our releases over the coming weeks. We divided this period in 3 stages. Every stage roughly represents 2 weeks, starting in week 4. The last stage represents only one week, in this week we will optimize our agent and finish it. Because we are not sure yet how much work every part is and what will be difficult our schedule is somewhat loose at the moment. This will change when we start writing code, because we will get a better view of the items that take a lot of time at that point.\\
