\section{Reflection on the product and process from a software engineering perspective}
In this section we will reflect on the product and the process of creating it.

Every tuesday there was a meeting at Tygron where we could discuss with all the other groups and ask questions to the people responsible for the default environment.
During the first few weeks we didn't actually write any code as we were figuring out the Tygron engine and setting up the Tygron project we wanted to use as our working project. 
After this we started with improving the connector/environment, and figuring out how the environment worked with creating percepts (for GOAL) and how it figured out what actions were available.
After we had a decent understanding of the available actions and percepts we started working on the goal project/agent, this is where we could actually see things change on the Tygron project.
At this point we ran into several problems with the environment where the percepts didn't contain everything we need to make the agent actually try to accomplish it's assigned indicators.

In retrospect we should have immediately started with figuring out how the environment worked and what it's limitations were.
We should also have asked more questions about where to find the available actions and percepts at the start of the project.
