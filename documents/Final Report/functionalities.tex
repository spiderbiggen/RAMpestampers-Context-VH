\chapter{Description of the developed functionalities}
In this section the functionalities of our agent will be described.
The functionalities that we have now are based on the strategy and vision we had in mind at the beginning of the project.
The features we did not implement and the reasons why we did not implement them will be described in the next chapters. 
We implemented these features to make the agent act like a normal person.
A normal person playing the Tygron game can also use the actions described below, so our agent should be able to use them too.

The agent has indicators that represents our vision of the TU Delft.
Inicators are 'scores' on a scale from 0 to 100 that represent how well the agent is doing.
For example, building something can improve a certain indicator.
At the end, the agent wants to get a score of 100 on all indicators, because that means it has fulfilled all its goals.

\section{Building functionality}
The indicators that are used for building constructions are building high constructions, extending the education space and building green.
The developed agent is able to achieve these indicators. 
It has the functionality to build high buildings, this functionality has the highest priority as it will help us reach our other indicators as well.
When building high buildings, the education space will be extended as well, so the agent is able to combine these two indicators with one functionality.
When the agent has a piece of land that is not suitable for a building, it will build green to achieve the green indicator goal.

\section{Demolish functionality}
When there is no land available to build a construction, the agent needs to demolish a building to create land for a new construction.
It does so by demolishing old buildings, which is another indicator of the agent.
This indicator will get a better score when old buildings are demolished.

\section{Sell land functionality}
If the agent has land that is not suitable for any construction, it is not necessary to keep that land. When this is the case, the agent will try to sell that piece of land. This is beneficial for the budget.

\section{Request functionality}
The agent is able to answer requests from other stakeholders. Requests are either accepted or declined. A request is declined when another agent wants to buy a piece of land that is planned for building a construction. Other requests that are beneficial for the agentâ€™s indicators are accepted.

\section{Buy land functionality}
The agent can buy land. This will happen when the agent doesn't have any old buildings left to destroy, but it still wants to build new buildings. The agent will send a request to buy some land to another stakeholder, which will hopefully accept its offer. When it does accept the offer, the agent will build more buildings on this new piece of land.

\section{Upgrade functionality}
If the agent still has some old buildings, but the 'build green' and the 'build high buildings' indicators are full, it will upgrade these old buildings to newer buildings.
