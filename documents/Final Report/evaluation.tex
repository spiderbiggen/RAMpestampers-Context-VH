\section{Failure Analysis}
Failures in the agent are usually the result of a failure in the environment, since the environment is what actually interprets the agent's actions.
These failures more often than not throw an error which can be read in the agent's console output.
Many possible failures are caught in the tests of the connector, but some of the failures only show up once an agent is run using that version of the connector.
