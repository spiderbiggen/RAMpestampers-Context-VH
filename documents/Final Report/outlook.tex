\chapter{Outlook}
In this section we will talk about the future of the product and what are enhancements for the connector and goal code that could improve the product. Also we will talk about the virtual humans context project and what we think could improve the project for future students.

\section {Product}
Our current agent has no way to find out how a certain indicator can be improved, we had to hardcode the names of the indicators. This could be a big improvement to make the agent a lot more dynamic. Changes in the connector and possibly in the SDK are needed for this, but it would make programming an agent a lot more convenient.

Another improvement would be to change the way land works, our agent currently has to work with multipolygons which makes most computations impossible. Because of this a lot of functionality is moved to the connector. Having to make a function call to the environment for every calculation with land does not work very well for an agent that has to do city planning. For example, if a stakeholder wants to sell us a piece of land our agent should make a good decision about this. To make a good decision it needs to know where the land is, what buildings are on it and if it is suitable for building. But our agent can not figure out all this information by itself. A grid of the landscape where every building is built within cells would be a solution for this, making it a lot easier to see collisions and locations. This would require a lot of changes to the connector and api though, but would enable our agent with a lot more possibilities.

To get our agent to behave more like a human there are some enhancements we could make as well. Our current agent has a very specific strategy which will execute in exactly the same order most of the time. This is something that could be improved, as this makes the agent predictable, where a human would act more randomly. The agent also has very fast decision making, where a human would take its time to respond, the agent responds immediately to most things. When playing as a human this seems a bit odd, and a delay should be introduced.
