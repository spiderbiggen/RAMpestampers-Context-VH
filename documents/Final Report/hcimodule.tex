\chapter{Development of the HCI module}
In this section a brief introduction will be given about the interaction between the user and the agent. When a user wants to play a session in the Tygron engine, but not every stakeholder is able to play their role at that time, the agent can take his place and play the role of the TU Delft stakeholder. The agent responds to the actions that the user makes in a logical way. To achieve this, multiple interaction design techniques were used and the interaction was tested by using a Turingtest. All of these are described in detail in appendix A.
