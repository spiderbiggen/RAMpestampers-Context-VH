\section{Introduction}

In this document we’ll describe the architecture of our product for the Virtual Humans context project. It should give insight in the design of our system. First we will identify our design goals, which should represent the things that we find to be important for this project.


\subsection{Design goals}

\subsubsection*{Manageability}
We’re working with multiple project groups and have to maintain the same code for the connector. It’s important that we keep this code manageable, enabling every group to make modifications as needed, without breaking other parts of the code.

\subsubsection*{Performance}
From our previous MAS project we know that goal code can get really slow when you don’t take performance into consideration while coding. We should try to keep our design as efficient as possible to prevent these kind of problems.

\subsubsection*{Scalability}
Although we’re developing our agent for just one scenario in this project, there’s a change it will be used in larger scenarios and we should design so that this would be possible if ever needed.

\subsubsection*{Reliability}
Since our agent will be used to replace a missing player in a game it’s important that this agent is  reliable. If during a play session with multiple users the agent fails and the game has to be restarted this is not only frustrating for the players, but can also cost a lot of money since some of the players are well paid employees.

\subsubsection*{Securability}
The agents login to the system of Tygron and have a direct connection to their server running during a game. We should keep this in mind while designing the system.

\subsubsection*{Availability}
There should be a working version at all times, so that when a player is missing for a game the game can be played anyway. Not knowing if an agent is available could cause a whole game to be unplayable because of a missing player.
