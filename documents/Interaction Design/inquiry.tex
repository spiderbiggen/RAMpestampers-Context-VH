\section{Contextual Inquiry}
In this section, the four principles of the contextual inquiry are described. The four principles are context, partnership, interpretation and focus.

\subsection{Context}
In this project, the Tygron Engine is the engine in which the agents should run. The first week was planned to get used to the engine. Knowing how the engine works, is important for the development of the agent. To achieve this knowledge, we visited Tygron in the first week for questions and explanation about the engine.
