\section{Introduction}
Tygron is a company that builds serious games for urban planning. Communities can generate and maintain realistic games to find solutions for city design and development projects. A game consists of a scenario in which several players play different roles, these players are real people. The goal of the virtual humans for serious gaming context project is to develop virtual humans that simulate the people in the tygron game. Virtual humans can ensure that a serious game can be played even when not all players in the scenario are present.
