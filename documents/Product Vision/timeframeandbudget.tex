\section{Timeframe and Budget}
The product is going to be developed during a student project and the timeframe is therefore limited. The project has a duration of ten weeks and is worth ten ECTs (European Credit Transfer System) for each of the five students. Which means every student will have 25 up to 30 hours per week available to work on the project. After these ten weeks the product should be finished. Therefor a strict planning is needed.

The students will not receive any payment for their work. Only the TU delft and Tygron will make some costs for this project. Both will have to assign some of their employees to help the students with the development of the product. Tygron needs to maintain a server for the students to work on and also needs to provide a workspace every tuesday morning.
