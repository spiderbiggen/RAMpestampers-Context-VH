\section{Target Customer}
As already stated in the introduction, Tygron builds serious games for urban planning. Those games are meant to be played by real people as described by the company Tygron\cite{2016}. Tygron is interested in simulating those people by virtual humans and is therefore our target customer.\\
\\
Tygron wants to ensure that a game can be played, even when not all the players in a scenario are present. Virtual humans are the solution to that. Those virtual humans have to make decisions and actions in such a way, that it can be compared to a real human. While finding solution to city design and development projects, it is important that all the communities in a scenario are present. The absence of a community can have a major effect on the final solution to a scenario. A not good functioning virtual human, can therefore have an effect on the final solution to a scenario as well.
