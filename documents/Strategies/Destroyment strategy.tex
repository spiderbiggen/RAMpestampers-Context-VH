\section{Introduction}
In this document the strategy about destroying buildings will be explained. In the first section the reason to destroy a building will be defined, and in the second section the choice for a particular building will be clarified. This document will be used to implement the following user story:\\
\\
\textit{"As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to destroy stuff if I think 
this is benificial for me\\
To make room for construction or to 
optimize a certain indicator."\\}

There are two important parts in this user story that need to be discussed before implementing anything. The 'stuff' part: so which buildings need to be destroyed, and the 'benificial' part: so when buildings need to be destroyed. Again, these two questions will be discussed in the following two sections.

\section{When/why to destroy buildings}
In this section the reasons to destroy a building will be explained. There are two types of reasons and both of them ultimately give a better indicator score. The first reason is to directly influence an indicator, and the second reason is to make space for a new building that influences an indicator. Both will be discussed in the following sections.

\subsection{Direct influence}

\subsection{Indirect influence}
