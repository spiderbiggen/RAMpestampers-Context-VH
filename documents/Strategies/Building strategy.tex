\section{Introduction}

In this document the strategy about the decision of building buildings and which buildings will be explained. In the first section the reason to build a building will be defined, and in the second section the choice for a particular building will be clarified. This document will be used to implement the following user story:\\
\\
\textit{"As an agent\\
When in a simulation\\
I am able to build stuff if I think 
this is benificial for me\\
To optimize a certain indicator."\\}

\section{When/why to build buildings}
In this section the reasons to build a building will be explained. The first reason to build a building, is that it can influence an indicator in a positive way. Another reason why to build something, is that a building can give you profit in terms of your budget.


\subsection{Direct influence}
There is one direct reason to build a building. We created an indicator that has the goal to make high buildings. The more high buildings, the better the indicator will be. But there is a downside with building something. Building a building costs a lot of money and the budget is not unlimited. The agent will build stuff as long as the budget holds and as long as it gives a positive influence on the indicators.


\section{Which building to build}
This section explains which building to build. Because our vision is to build high buildings, the buildings that are build, needs to be high buildings. In this way, it is more beneficial for the indicators. So when there is ground left, a high building is built on that ground if it beneficial for the indicators.


\section{Summary}
To achieve the goals (optimize the scores of the indicators) it is necessary to build high  buildings. When the agent chooses to build a building it has to choose one of the high buildings, because these improve the score of an indicator. The agent keeps building until the end of the session or until it achieves all its goals.
